# MAIN
A repository contains all the files for our project, including the revision history. 

# TARGET
Our target is to build a platform for people working together, so that they can create a workflow for their team work on the platform. A workflow consists of many parts, each of which is assigned to a specific person. Different parts are isolate but connected, which means that everyone can only charge for his own part but all parts will be finished in order.
